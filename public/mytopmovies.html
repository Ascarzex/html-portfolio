<h1>Movies Reviews According to Arturo</h1>

<h2>Last 3 Movies that I've seen and enjoyed on a cinema 
    plus who I went with hehe</h2>

<h3>Wicked</h3>
<p>I was excited to see this movie with my sister. It did not dissappoint at all. 
    I really enjoyed it from start to finish, almost didn't blink!</p>

<h3>Joker 2</h3>
<p>For this movie I went with my friend Karen. We were gladly surprised by this
    movie being a musical. We loved every bit of it. Even sang along some of 
    the songs haha.</p>

<h3>Terrifier 3</h3>
<p>I went with Alfredo, a guy that I met recently. Most of the time, we would 
    squint our eyes from disgust or shock. It was a movie full of gore and 
    absolutely bizarre scenes. However, we were looking forward to all of that :D
